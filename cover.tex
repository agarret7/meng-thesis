\title{Infrastructure for Modeling and Inference Engineering with 3D Generative Scene Graphs}

\author{Austin J. Garrett}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\prevdegrees{B.S. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Physics \\
             Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2020}
\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Vikash K. Mansinghka}{Principal Research Scientist}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Katrina LaCurts}{Chair, Master of Engineering Thesis Committee}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}
% \end{abstractpage}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This work was conducted with the support of an amazing team of collaborators and mentors, and would not be possible without them.
I am grateful to Marco Cusumano-Towner for encouraging and sharpening my exploration of deep technical questions.
His genuine curiosity and passion for his work is an inspiration to always keep digging at the hard technical problems, and to always strive for a deeper understanding.
I thank my adviser Vikash Mansinghka for his guidance in my journey through this program.
I greatly appreciate his dedication to finding and encouraging the good in his students and collaborators, and the positive leadership example he sets by doing so.
He has patiently helped me to see the value in my own work, and as such led me to gain a better appreciation for what it actually takes to do research.

My Master's would not have been the same Ben Zinberg; he has been a consistent bright light through the dark spots.
I appreciate him for his collaboration on the work in this thesis, his humor, and above all, his friendship.
Rachel Paiste has been a consistently grounding presence in the ever changing sea that has been the COVID pandemic.
Her persistent support in the more challenging of times has been an invaluable source of stability, for which I am incredibly grateful.
I'd like to thank Nishad Gothoskar, Falk Pollok, Aldo Pareja, and Javier Felipe Leon for their collaboration on and work on the project leading up to this thesis.
Many others members and affiliates of MIT's aided in the development of this thesis through discussions and interactions; I'd like to thank Alex Lew and Tan Zhi-Xuan for growing my understanding of the deep field of probabilistic programming, Amanda Brower for her support, and Nick Charchut for being a bud.

Finally, none of this would've been possible without my parents David and Laura Garrett, who taught me genuinity of heart and sacrificed so much to help me succeed.
Because of them, I am free to do what I love.

This research was funded by the DARPA Machine Common Sense program, under (sub)contract CW3013540.
