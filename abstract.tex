%% It will be single-spaced and the rest of the text that is supposed to go on
%% the abstract page will be generated by the abstractpage environment.  This
%% file should be \input (not \include 'd) from cover.tex.

%% The main argument of your work should appear here. Successful abstracts give
%% readers a clear idea of the project while also encouraging them to read the
%% full proposal. In your abstract you should briefly define the problem and its
%% significance, summarize your approach to solving the problem, and provide a
%% forcast of your results.
