%% Should contain a brief summary of the backgroud of the problem and/or overall
%% area you are investigating. You should state your particular motivation for
%% working on the present problem in your thesis as well as reasons for how and
%% why your solution(s) will contribute a new work to the field. In other words,
%% you are articulating a gap in current knowledge. Your thesis should be arguable
%% or falsifiable; the statement you make should be able to be challenged. The
%% terms that you use in your thesis should have strong, clear definitions --
%% perhaps not in the thesis statement itself, but in the same paragraph. For
%% example, your readers will want to know what you mean by "optimal",
%% "efficient", or "high performance".
%% 
%% You should be able to explain the central idea of your thesis with one
%% sentence; if that sentence is too complicated to craft, you may have too many
%% distinct ideas. Remember, your thesis is not the place where you solve all
%% problems -- focus on the original work that you are doing, which is distinct
%% form and important to other work being done in your field.
