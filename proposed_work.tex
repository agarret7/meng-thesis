%% In this section, along with an outline of the wokr that you plan to do -- from
%% the start to the end of your project -- you should also indicate what you think
%% could possibly change as you embark on and continually work on your thesis. In
%% the outline of your work, you might want to describe your methods of data
%% collection, any hardware or software you plan to build or implement, or any
%% algorithms you design. Who you are and what you bring to your work will also
%% help define what you plan to do. Here I quote Professor Neil Spring quite
%% broadly:
%% 
%%   Provide personal insight [to your thesis proposal]. You undoubtedly have a
%%   different way of viewing the world than anyone else, perhaps more theoretical
%%   or practical or empirical or operational. Maybe you think more like a user or
%%   more like a software engineer. [Maybe you had an interesting internship or
%%   spend a summer abroad.] Perhaps your undergraduate minor shapes your
%%   worldview.
%% 
%%   Wherever this project leads you, it's what you bring to the process that
%%   makes it interesting for everyone else. Focus on techniques. Focus on the
%%   methods and how they can be applied to solve a problem. You can make an
%%   exception if conflicating or changing results motivate further analysis.
%%   Often the inputs (workload, applications, processor speeds, network speeds)
%%   will change, and so the results (performace, comparisons) and conclusions
%%   will change with them.
%% 
%% You should also indicate what kind of equipment, facilities, data, or other
%% material you may need for the completion of your work. It is imperative that
%% you provide a timeline or a clear schedule that indicates a plan for your
%% thesis work. In this plan you and your thesis supervisor should come to an
%% agreement on goals for each month of the project including (but not limited to)
%% experiments, data collection, analysis, any refining, drafting of thesis, final
%% results, and revision of thesis. You are welcome to insert a chart with a
%% summary of your goals for each month. Most EECS Master's degree theses are
%% assigned a total number of 360 hours. We ask that you plan accordingly.
