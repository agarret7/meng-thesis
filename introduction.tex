\section{Introduction}

  The past decade has seen a flourishing of highly powerful computer vision
  techniques, due to the success of deep learning techniques accelerated on
  massively parallel hardware.

  Yet the shortcomings of neural techniques have only grown increasingly urgent
  in proportion to their dominance. While these approaches have resulted in the
  amortization of traditionally very difficult and high-dimensional computer
  vision problems, the lack of semantic structuring in their output has led to
  great challenges in their deployment in practical domains where
  interpretability and composability are desperately needed to integrate these
  components into larger frameworks.

  Meanwhile probabilistic techniques offer a more principled approach to
  modeling structured data, and the ecosystem for using these tools has rapidly
  expanded. Such environments are desirable for their expressibility,
  corresponding to the fact that they often represent intuitive models of
  rationality inspired from cognitive and neuroscience which increasingly rely
  on such modeling to explain the human reasoning. In this thesis, I will
  explore probabilistic methods for combining neural detectors with richly
  structured priors in order to filter and improve the robustness of the
  network's output.
