In this thesis, I consider Bayesian approaches to doing inference over
structured scenes. This includes the design and implementation of a
probabilistic language for representing semantic relations between multiple
objects. I further consider a strategy for integrating neural techniques into
MCMC-based techniques for inverse graphics, where a generative model is
constructed to predict the behavior of neural detectors, allowing for error
correction and semantic structuring of the output. I finally discuss the
development of a framework for realtime particle filter based inference based
on the Robot Operating System and Gen probabilistic programming language, as
well as its integration into the broader Cora project for probabilistic
modeling of intuitive physics.
