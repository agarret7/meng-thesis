\section{Introduction}

  The past decade has seen a flourishing of highly powerful computer vision
  techniques, due to the success of deep learning techniques accelerated on
  massively parallel hardware.

  Yet the shortcomings of neural techniques have only grown increasingly urgent
  in proportion to their dominance. While these approaches have resulted in the
  amortization of traditionally very difficult and high-dimensional computer
  vision problems, the lack of semantic structuring in their output has led to
  great challenges in their deployment in practical domains where
  interpretability and composability are desperately needed to integrate these
  components into larger frameworks.

  Meanwhile probabilistic techniques offer a more principled approach to modeling
  structured data, and have seen a rapid growth in the collective ecosystem. Such
  environments are desirable for their expressibility, corresponding to the fact
  that they often represent intuitive models of rationality inspired from
  cognitive and neuroscience which increasingly rely on such modeling to explain
  the human reasoning.


  DATASET??

  This part is a highly relevent research goal, due to the undervaluing of
  semantic structuring of information by the neural network community. In
  some sense we are trying to provide a solution to a problem that is not
  fully visible to the community, or at the very least is thought to be
  "too hard" for current techniques. Hard grounding metrics, or at least a
  fuller range of explicitly specified common-sense tasks will go a long
  way in changing the over-skeptical perspective toward Bayesian techniques
  trying to answer this question. Thus, an important part of the thesis
  work will be identifying the gap that exists between types of problems
  that we'd like to solve (common sense reasoning), and how neural networks
  currently fail to address these problems, as well as providing as much of
  a solution as we can in the time available, which we believe will be
  compelling enough to demonstrate the utility of Bayesian methods in
  modern CV pipelines.
